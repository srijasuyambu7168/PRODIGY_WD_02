I have built a stopwatch web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The HTML structures the elements of the application, while the CSS enhances its visual appeal. The JavaScript implementation includes functions for starting, pausing, and resetting the stopwatch, as well as for tracking and displaying lap times.
This allows users to accurately measure and record time intervals. You can access the live website through this.
Includes the following features:

Start and Pause: Easily start and pause the stopwatch with a single click.
Reset: Reset the stopwatch to zero with a dedicated button.
Lap Times: Track and display lap times to measure specific intervals accurately.
Responsive Design: With a vedio background and Optimized for various screen sizes to ensure a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
